*DAISY implementation baby oh yeah
  - convolutions - optimise the ones in Y to run in same time as X
  - transpositions - profile + optimise
  - manage sectioning of input images into 1024x1024 sections for larger images
  - manage sectioning of images into 512x512 during final transposition
  - make final transposition parameters (workgroup size + steps per worker) changeable
(transposeDaisy kernel)
  // todo;
  // require group size 16x16
  // fill zeros in petals that source outside the borders - center-symmetrical property of petals?
  // simplify?

test data
record performance test results with visual profiler
BP implementation

LOW

*for report
  - make incremental optimisation kernels (convolution)
  - correctness testing (conv, gradients)
software license?
*belief propagation matching - heavy reading papers/code understand bp - understood up until a point, read sift flow code or other to understand properly, wait until DAISY is done
-choose objective function for BP - vaguely done, leave for later
GIT setup online github

WAIT

RGB or grayscale images? - grayscale

DONE

GIT setup
**lit review
*DAISY implementation
  - tested transposition by storing source indeces
