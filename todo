*DAISY implementation baby oh yeah
  - transpose
  - profile + optimise (1024 sections)
  - manage sectioning into 1024x1024 sections for larger images
---
MEDIUM
---
gradient borders
test data
record performance test results with visual profiler
BP implementation
---
LOW
---
*for report
  - make incremental optimisation kernels (convolution)
  - correctness testing (conv, gradients)
software license?
*belief propagation matching - heavy reading papers/code understand bp - understood up until a point, read sift flow code or other to understand properly, wait until DAISY is done
-choose objective function for BP - vaguely done, leave for later
GIT setup online github

WAIT

RGB or grayscale images? - grayscale

DONE

GIT setup
**lit review
*DAISY implementation
  - tested transposition by storing source indeces
