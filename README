Third Year Project in Computer Science at Bath, UK. (2011-12)

The project title is "Fast cross-device dense pixel correspondence using DAISY descriptors and OpenCL"

It is aiming 

1) to use OpenCL on graphics cards to implement the computation of the DAISY descriptor
(cvlab.epfl.ch/alumni/tola/daisy.html) for an image in a dense fashion, ie compute a descriptor for 
every pixel in the image, or a large subset.

2) use Belief Propagation (on GPU again with OpenCL) to (after DAISY descriptor images have been computed
for two images) to search for the pixel correspondence between two images. This is also aimed to be done
densely, ie for as many descriptors as are available in the descriptor images

The implementation of this application in OpenCL should broaden the usability/applicability of such an
algorithm to a range of different hardware/software without specific system versions or requirements.
This relies on the, currently strong, support of major OS/hardware developers towards OpenCL.

Progress:
07/02/12 - Implemented DAISY up until all the smoothing/gradient kernels, the data on the GPU now needs
          to be transposed.... in a 4D type of transposition (AxBxCxD to CxDxAxB) ... fun!
          After this DAISY will be done and optimisations will need to be made, before proceeding to BP.
